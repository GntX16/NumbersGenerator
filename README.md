# 🎲 NumbersGenerator

Do you need a fast generator to pick a random number (depending on your desired bound)? Then you’ve come to the right repository!

## ⬇️ Installation

Simply download the file and add it to your IDE project. You can run it directly because the `main` method is already included.

## ❔ Usage

It’s very easy: Adjust the upper bound on line 9 of the code (for example 10, 100, ...). After that, you’re ready to go :)

**Have fun generating your random numbers!**
